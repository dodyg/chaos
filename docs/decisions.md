# Architecture/implementation decisions

Date-ordered decisions that resolve PLAN/SPEC omissions during implementation. Product
authority stays with `SPEC.md`; PLAN.md pins stay binding.

## 2026-11-09

- **Roslynk is not used for C# editing.** The user directed ("Skip using roslynk") that the
  Roslynk MCP/CLI editing workflow (PLAN §3) be skipped in favor of this session's normal
  file-edit tools. All other PLAN §3 rules still apply: diagnostics via builds/tests,
  Slopwatch after C# batches, full builds for release gates.
- **`frontend/.npmrc` sets `install-links=true`.** The template declares the generated
  `@neoastra/client` (staged under `obj/neoastra/client`) as a `file:` dependency; npm's
  symlink installation requires Windows symlink privileges that restricted environments do
  not grant. Packed-copy installation keeps the plan-required build order and version
  alignment unchanged.
- **`Chaos.slnx` is hand-authored.** The .NET 11 rc SDK's `dotnet sln add` against a
  `.slnx` mis-detects filename collisions across solution folders ("Solution folder 'src'
  already contains..."), so the solution file is maintained directly in the simple
  `<Project Path="..." />` form.
- **Solution-level `dotnet test` fallback.** MTP solution mode downloads a dotnet-test
  extension from `builds.dotnet.microsoft.com` on first use and talks to test
  executables over named pipes; restricted environments may refuse both. `eng/verify.ps1`
  tries the solution run first and falls back to direct TUnit executable runs (each an
  MTP runner), failing on any nonzero-exit or zero-test module (PLAN §16).
- **Task title limits.** Title normalization enforces 500 Unicode scalar values (not
  UTF-16 units) with the limit stated in the error text (PLAN §6).
- **Publishing never touches NuGet lock files.** `eng/publish-windows.ps1` passes
  `-p:RestorePackagesWithLockFile=false`; a `-r win-x64` restore would otherwise write a
  RID group into every `packages.lock.json` and break later `--locked-mode` restores
  (NU1004). Lock files stay stable for the plain/locked restore workflow.
- **Storage failures keep their cause as InnerException.** `SqliteErrorMapper` maps
  SQLite errors to stable `AppErrorKind`s whose messages never contain SQL, paths or
  stack traces; the original exception is attached as `InnerException` so logs and test
  output can still diagnose. Renderer-facing strings are unchanged.
- **Task Position starts at 0 and grows by gaps of 1024.** The SQLite store computes
  `COALESCE(MAX(Position), -1024) + 1024` (first task in a container gets 0); the
  in-memory test fake mirrors this so Application and Infrastructure tests agree.
